# NeuralNet-Basic

a basic neural net approach to figure out how to code that stuff

you will need the [Qt Core library](https://qt.io "Qt homepage") to run it

## NOTE: CMakeLists.txt is made for a library and test projects, so it won't work as it is here, just comment every file where it says "file not found" out
